# Flask Webapp for a Photography Portfolio

This is a web-application built with Python, hosted for free on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com), and used to display my personal photography portfolio.

The website is available to browse [here](http://ansla.pythonanywhere.com).
<br>
**üí•Tip**: turn off 'Prevent Cross-Site Tracking' in Safari to view images if they are not loading.

## Features

The webapp features a home page with album covers for each of my photo-series, each series (album) is accessible in its own subpage by clicking on the cover. To navigate back to the home page, each subpage contains a 'back' menu.

The site is run using **Flask** for its back-end, **Plotly** graphing library for displaying the map on the home page, and **HTML/CSS** for formatting the home page and photo-series subpages.

The code is hosted on GitHub and is continuously deployed at [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) using their free resources, with updates to the website happening automatically after every `push` event.

All images are shot by me, edited using my own Adobe Lightroom presets (Lightroom is available for free on mobile), and are stored for free via my Google Drive.
<br>
**üí•Tip**: loading large-resolution images from Google Drive might take a few seconds.

### Geographical Data and Plotly 

###Hosting and Deployment
To create webapp hosting and ensure free continuous deployment at PythonAnywhere I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZMQVI6Ss64). It explains how to use GitHub webhooks, git hooks, and the PythonAnywhere interface to host and seamlessly update your site.
<br>
**üí•Tip**: In troubleshooting GitHub webhooks, check if your repository is public. Otherwise, the continuous deployment procedure described in the video may not work (`Error 500`).
